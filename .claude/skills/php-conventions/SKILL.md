# PHP 8.5 / Symfony 6.4 / DDD Conventions

**Rigid** — follow these patterns exactly. Deviating breaks Doctrine hydration, DI autowiring, or DDD boundaries.

## DDD Namespace Conventions

Code is organized by bounded context, not by technical layer. Every class lives under `App\{Context}\{Layer}\`:

```
App\Admission\Infrastructure\Entity\Application
App\Admission\Api\State\ApplicationProcessor
App\Admission\Domain\Rules\ApplicationStatusRule
App\Shared\Entity\Semester
App\Support\Infrastructure\Mailer\Mailer
```

**Domain layer** (`{Context}\Domain\`): Pure PHP only. No `use Doctrine\*`, no `use Symfony\*`, no `use ApiPlatform\*`. If you need a framework import, the class belongs in Infrastructure or Api, not Domain.

Domain/Rules may **read** same-context Infrastructure entities (type hints, getters). Domain/Rules must **never construct or mutate** entities — that's a factory/service concern for Infrastructure.

Domain never imports across contexts. When Domain logic depends on values from another context's enum/constants, define local `private const` mirrors:
```php
// In Admission/Domain/Rules/ApplicationStatusRule.php
// Mirror of InterviewStatusType constants (Interview context)
private const INTERVIEW_PENDING = 0;
private const INTERVIEW_ACCEPTED = 1;
```

**Infrastructure layer** (`{Context}\Infrastructure\`): Framework-coupled. May import from other contexts' Infrastructure (Doctrine requires this for cross-context entity relations).

**Cross-context entity references**: Always use `::class` syntax in Doctrine attributes, never short string names:
```php
// Correct:
#[ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity: User::class)]

// Wrong — breaks when entities are in different namespaces:
#[ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity: 'User')]
```

## Doctrine Entity Properties

Do NOT add native PHP type declarations to entity collection properties. Doctrine hydrates via reflection — typed properties break when Doctrine assigns `PersistentCollection` to `array` or vice versa.

```php
// Correct — untyped with PHPDoc:
/** @var Collection<int, TeamMembership> */
#[ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity: TeamMembership::class, mappedBy: 'team')]
private $teamMemberships;

// Wrong — breaks Doctrine hydration:
private Collection $teamMemberships;
private array $teamMemberships = [];
```

Keep `is_countable()` guards on `count()` calls for entity collections — entities constructed outside Doctrine (tests, fixtures) may have null collections.

## Dependency Injection

Constructor DI only. No `getDoctrine()`, `$this->get()`, or `$this->container->get()`. Without this: Sf6 runtime errors.

Session: `$this->requestStack->getSession()`. Not `SessionInterface` injection — not autowirable in Sf6.

Password hashing: inject `UserPasswordHasherInterface`. Not `password_encoder`.

## PHP 8 Attributes

All mapping uses attributes, not annotations:
- Routing: `#[Route('/path', name: 'route_name')]`
- Doctrine: `#[ORM\Entity]`, `#[ORM\Column]`, etc.
- Validation: `#[Assert\NotBlank]`, `#[Assert\Length]`, etc.

## API Platform

DTOs in `{Context}/Api/Resource/`. Providers/processors in `{Context}/Api/State/`.

Serialization groups: `entity:read` on scalar props for collections. Add `entity:detail` for detail views. Omit groups on relation properties entirely. Without this: circular reference errors.

`#[ApiFilter]` is forbidden — `api-platform/doctrine-orm` isn't registered in the test container. Use custom providers for filtering.

Auth-required operations: `security: "is_granted('ROLE_USER')"` on the operation.

Slugs: use `SluggerInterface` from `symfony/string` — handles Norwegian chars (æ/ø/å) via ICU transliteration.

## Rate Limiting

Login: `login_throttling` in `security.yml` (firewall-level, automatic).

Other endpoints: inject `RateLimiterFactory` with naming convention `$limiterNameLimiter` where `limiter_name` matches the key in `framework.rate_limiter` config.

State processors: inject `RequestStack` for `$this->requestStack->getCurrentRequest()?->getClientIp()`.

Test environment: `config_test.yml` overrides limits to 1000.

## PHP 8.5 Patterns

Constructor properties: `private readonly` promoted for all injected dependencies. Only omit `readonly` when the property is reassigned after construction (cache arrays, derived state).

Unused catch variables: `catch (\Exception)` not `catch (\Exception $e)`.

Imports: fully qualified in `use` statements, alphabetically ordered.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/server
composer analyse    # PHPStan level 5 + strict rules
composer deptrac    # DDD boundary enforcement
composer syntax     # php-parallel-lint
composer lint       # PHP-CS-Fixer
composer test:unit  # Unit tests (<1s)
```
